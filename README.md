🌎 Object Detection & Tracking: Benchmarking Models.
 YOLO, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN 

In a recent project, I evaluated 15 cutting-edge object detection models, integrating ByteTrack for robust tracking and real-time object counting. The tests were conducted on Google Colab, focusing on performance (FPS), detection efficiency, and real-time tracking.

🔍 Key Features & Capabilities:
 ✅ Multi-model support for different detection frameworks
 ✅ High-performance object tracking using ByteTrack
 ✅ Automated counting of objects crossing defined lines
 ✅ Optimized for real-time inference with CUDA acceleration
 ✅ Custom video processing pipeline with frame skipping, resizing, and adaptive thresholds

🔍 Key Findings:
✅ Fastest Models (Best for Real-Time Processing) 
YOLOv8s (59.53 FPS), YOLOv5su (58.66 FPS), YOLO11s (57.61 FPS), and YOLOX-s (56.2 FPS) proved to be the best for real-time detection.
→ Ideal for high-speed applications.
✅ Most Accurate but Slower Models and Computationally Expensive:
Faster R-CNN (10.6 FPS), EfficientDet D3 (10.59 FPS) 
→ Prioritize accuracy over speed, making them better suited for offline processing.
✅ Best Balance of Speed & Performance:
YOLO12s (41.42 FPS), YOLOX-m (39.92 FPS), YOLOv5mu (43.69 FPS) → Strong trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.
* YOLO12l (21.35 FPS) is a slower but potentially more precise model.

💡 Conclusion:
 For real-time tracking: YOLOX, YOLO5su, YOLO11s are top picks.
 For accuracy-focused tasks: Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, YOLO12l stand out.
 For general-purpose detection: YOLO12s, YOLOX-m offer solid performance.
